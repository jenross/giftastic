Giftastic

This UCF Coding Boot Camp homework assignment utilizes the GIPHY API to display the top 10 gifs associated with each search term. Users can add a button by typing another category into the text input field. 

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, the GIPHY API, and AJAX calls to create the app and display gifs associated with a variety of emotions. The user can click on the gif to play it and click it again to make it go back to a still state.
